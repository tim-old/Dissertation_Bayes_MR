# Abstract {-}

## Background

Mendelian randomisation (MR) is an analytical framework for observational studies based on the principles of instrumental variable (IV) analysis; it uses genetic data to support valid inference of causal links between various exposures and outcomes of interest. The field of MR has recently been challenged by high false-positive report rates, including causal links being reported between exposures and outcomes where this would not be biologically plausible. MR-Hevo is a novel MR causal effect estimation methodology grounded in a Bayesian re-sampling approach, in contrast to established frequentist methods such as the weighted median estimator (WME) method.

## Aims

To evaluate the performance of the WME causal effect estimation method for MR studies versus the MR-Hevo method, and establish whether any differences observed might affect the validity of conclusions drawn in real-world studies.

## Methods

Performance of each method was compared through parallel analysis of simulated data with known characteristics, including presence and size of any true causal effect. Data were simulated as per the published approach used to validate the WME causal effect estimation method. Simulations represented a range of plausible combinations of both population parameters and violations of the assumptions of IV analysis. To investigate differences between methods using real-world data, both methods were applied to a sample of ten highly-cited MR studies where both a WME causal effect estimate and sufficient data to allow replication were reported.

## Results

Using simulated data with no causal effect present, MR-Hevo demonstrated a lower false-positive report rate versus WME across all 24 combinations of parameters/assumption violations considered (mean false-positive report rate 0.41% versus 5.1%). Using simulated data with a true causal effect present, MR-Hevo demonstrated variable sensitivity versus WME depending on the combination of parameters/assumption violations considered. In general, both higher false-positive rate and higher sensitivity with WME versus MR-Hevo analysis correlated with assumption violations which tended to bias away from the null, suggesting MR-Hevo may be more robust to assumption violations. In

## Conclusions

MR-Hevo causal effect estimation

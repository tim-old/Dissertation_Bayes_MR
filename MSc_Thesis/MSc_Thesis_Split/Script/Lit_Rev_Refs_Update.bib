	abstract = {To correct for confounding, the method of instrumental variables (IV) has been proposed. Its use in medical literature is still rather limited because of unfamiliarity or inapplicability. By introducing the method in a nontechnical way, we show that IV in a linear model is quite easy to understand and easy to apply once an appropriate instrumental variable has been identified. We also point out some limitations of the IV estimator when the instrumental variable is only weakly correlated with the exposure. The IV estimator will be imprecise (large standard error), biased when sample size is small, and biased in large samples when one of the assumptions is only slightly violated. For these reasons, it is advised to use an IV that is strongly correlated with exposure. However, we further show that under the assumptions required for the validity of the method, this correlation between IV and exposure is limited. Its maximum is low when confounding is strong, such as in case of confounding by indication. Finally, we show that in a study in which strong confounding is to be expected and an IV has been used that is moderately or strongly related to exposure, it is likely that the assumptions of IV are violated, resulting in a biased effect estimate. We conclude that instrumental variables can be useful in case of moderate confounding but are less useful when strong confounding exists, because strong instruments cannot be found and assumptions will be easily violated.},

	abstract = {This issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology reprints a seminal letter to the editor by Martijn Katan,1 which appears to be the first description of the concept of ‘Mendelian randomization.’ In discussing the controversy over whether the association between low serum cholesterol and cancer is causal or might simply reflect an effect of the disease to lower cholesterol levels (‘reverse causation’) or confounding by diet or other factors, Katan proposed a test of causality by studying instead the relationship between cancer and a genetic determinant of serum cholesterol, the apolipoprotein A (APOE) gene. His rationale was that since alleles are allocated essentially at random, such an association would not be subject to either confounding or reverse causation. Thus, if a causal relationship between APOE and serum cholesterol were clearly established, then an association between APOE and cancer would provide indirect evidence for the causality of the association between serum cholesterol and cancer. Although Katan did not use the term ‘Mendelian randomization’, the concept has been attributed to him and subsequently developed by a number of other authors.2–6 In particular, Davey Smith and Ebrahim2 have shown how the magnitude of the estimated effects of a gene (G) on an intermediate phenotype (IP) and on disease (D) can be combined to yield an estimate of the causal effect of the intermediate phenotype on disease, as illustrated in the following figure:  (where the dotted arrow from G to D represents the indirect association assumed to be mediated entirely through IP).},

We also present (1) a description of the connection between 4 causal models—counterfactuals, causal directed acyclic graphs, nonparametric structural equation models, and linear structural equation models—that have been used to describe instrumental variables methods; (2) a unified presentation of IV methods for the average causal effect in the study population through structural mean models; and (3) a discussion and new extensions of instrumental variables methods based on assumptions of monotonicity.},

	abstract = {The instrumental variable method has been employed within economics to infer causality in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Emphasising the parallels to randomisation may increase understanding of the underlying assumptions within epidemiology. An instrument is a variable that predicts exposure, but conditional on exposure shows no independent association with the outcome. The random assignment in trials is an example of what would be expected to be an ideal instrument, but instruments can also be found in observational settings with a naturally varying phenomenon e.g. geographical variation, physical distance to facility or physician’s preference. The fourth identifying assumption has received less attention, but is essential for the generalisability of estimated effects. The instrument identifies the group of compliers in which exposure is pseudo-randomly assigned leading to exchangeability with regard to unmeasured confounders. Underlying assumptions can only partially be tested empirically and require subject-matter knowledge. Future studies employing instruments should carefully seek to validate all four assumptions, possibly drawing on parallels to randomisation.},

The first aim of this paper is to compare three of those methods: the multivariable risk adjustment method, the propensity score risk adjustment method, and the instrumental variable method.

	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure–outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

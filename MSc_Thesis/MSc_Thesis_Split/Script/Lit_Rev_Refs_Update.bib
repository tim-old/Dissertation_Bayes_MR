We describe methods to overcome these limitations: key innovations are construction of scalar instruments from multiple SNPs, use of a regularized horseshoe prior, and hypothesis tests based on the marginal likelihood of the causal effect parameter. To demonstrate the approach, we constructed genotypic instruments from unlinked trans-pQTLs detected in two large GWAS studies of plasma proteins, and tested the top 20 genes for which the aggregated effects of the instruments was associated with type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank cohort. The only protein with clear evidence of a causal effect on type 2 diabetes was adiponectin, encoded by ADIPOQ: standardized log odds ratio -0.34 (95\% CI -0.44 to -0.24) using UK Biobank instruments. These results have implications for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Where the exposure under study is expression of a gene, restricting the instruments to cis-acting variants is likely to miss causal effects. Tests based on the marginal likelihood should supersede other methods of testing for causality in the presence of pleiotropy.},

The core functionality is to implement the inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger and weighted median methods for multiple genetic variants. Several options are available to the user, such as the use of robust regression, fixed- or random-effects models and the penalization of weights for genetic variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. Extensions to these methods, such as allowing for variants to be correlated, can be chosen if appropriate. Graphical commands allow summarized data to be displayed in an interactive graph, or the plotting of causal estimates from multiple methods, for comparison. Although the main method of data entry is directly by the user, there is also an option for allowing summarized data to be incorporated from the PhenoScanner database of genotype—phenotype associations. We hope to develop this feature in future versions of the package. The R software environment is available for download from [https://www.r-project.org/].

First, it identifies groups of genetic variants with similar causal estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Second, it performs MR robustly and efficiently in the presence of invalid IVs. Compared to other robust methods, it has the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method identifies 11 variants associated with increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased coronary heart disease risk that have the same directions of associations with various blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and coronary heart disease risk mediated via platelet aggregation.},

We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

	abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

First, the public availability of summary results from genome-wide association studies has led to an explosion of low-quality two-sample mendelian randomization (2SMR) studies. These studies add minimal – if any – value and overwhelm reviewers and journals. Second, the availability of large datasets with individual-level genotype data, like UK Biobank, has spurred the development and use of novel MR methods. However, some methods are being applied without proper testing, leading to misleading results, as exemplified by recent spurious findings that are being retracted and/or corrected relating to vitamin D. What can editors and peer reviewers do to handle the deluge of 2SMR studies and the premature application of highly complex MR methods? We advise editors to simply reject papers that only report 2SMR findings, with no additional supporting evidence. For reviewers receiving such papers, we provide a template for rejection. In addition, reviewers should demand rigorous testing of novel methods, including through the use of positive and negative controls before they are applied. Rejecting non-contributory 2SMR papers and imposing intensive scrutiny to novel methods is crucial if the scientific community is to reclaim MR.},

	abstract = {To correct for confounding, the method of instrumental variables (IV) has been proposed. Its use in medical literature is still rather limited because of unfamiliarity or inapplicability. By introducing the method in a nontechnical way, we show that IV in a linear model is quite easy to understand and easy to apply once an appropriate instrumental variable has been identified. We also point out some limitations of the IV estimator when the instrumental variable is only weakly correlated with the exposure. The IV estimator will be imprecise (large standard error), biased when sample size is small, and biased in large samples when one of the assumptions is only slightly violated. For these reasons, it is advised to use an IV that is strongly correlated with exposure. However, we further show that under the assumptions required for the validity of the method, this correlation between IV and exposure is limited. Its maximum is low when confounding is strong, such as in case of confounding by indication. Finally, we show that in a study in which strong confounding is to be expected and an IV has been used that is moderately or strongly related to exposure, it is likely that the assumptions of IV are violated, resulting in a biased effect estimate. We conclude that instrumental variables can be useful in case of moderate confounding but are less useful when strong confounding exists, because strong instruments cannot be found and assumptions will be easily violated.},

	abstract = {This issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology reprints a seminal letter to the editor by Martijn Katan,1 which appears to be the first description of the concept of ‘Mendelian randomization.’ In discussing the controversy over whether the association between low serum cholesterol and cancer is causal or might simply reflect an effect of the disease to lower cholesterol levels (‘reverse causation’) or confounding by diet or other factors, Katan proposed a test of causality by studying instead the relationship between cancer and a genetic determinant of serum cholesterol, the apolipoprotein A (APOE) gene. His rationale was that since alleles are allocated essentially at random, such an association would not be subject to either confounding or reverse causation. Thus, if a causal relationship between APOE and serum cholesterol were clearly established, then an association between APOE and cancer would provide indirect evidence for the causality of the association between serum cholesterol and cancer. Although Katan did not use the term ‘Mendelian randomization’, the concept has been attributed to him and subsequently developed by a number of other authors.2–6 In particular, Davey Smith and Ebrahim2 have shown how the magnitude of the estimated effects of a gene (G) on an intermediate phenotype (IP) and on disease (D) can be combined to yield an estimate of the causal effect of the intermediate phenotype on disease, as illustrated in the following figure:  (where the dotted arrow from G to D represents the indirect association assumed to be mediated entirely through IP).},

An instrument is a variable that predicts exposure, but conditional on exposure shows no independent association with the outcome. The random assignment in trials is an example of what would be expected to be an ideal instrument, but instruments can also be found in observational settings with a naturally varying phenomenon e.g. geographical variation, physical distance to facility or physician’s preference. The fourth identifying assumption has received less attention, but is essential for the generalisability of estimated effects. The instrument identifies the group of compliers in which exposure is pseudo-randomly assigned leading to exchangeability with regard to unmeasured confounders. Underlying assumptions can only partially be tested empirically and require subject-matter knowledge. Future studies employing instruments should carefully seek to validate all four assumptions, possibly drawing on parallels to randomisation.},

	abstract = {The main advantage of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the random assignment of treatment that prevents selection by prognosis. Nevertheless, only few RCTs can be performed given their high cost and the difficulties in conducting such studies. Therefore, several analytical methods for removing the effects of selection bias in observational studies have been proposed. The first aim of this paper is to compare three of those methods: the multivariable risk adjustment method, the propensity score risk adjustment method, and the instrumental variable method. The second aim is to compare the results from observational studies using the instrumental variable method with those from RCTs aiming to answer the same study question.},

	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure–outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

	abstract = {MendelianRandomization is a software package for the R open-source software environment that performs Mendelian randomization analyses using summarized data. The core functionality is to implement the inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger and weighted median methods for multiple genetic variants. Several options are available to the user, such as the use of robust regression, fixed- or random-effects models and the penalization of weights for genetic variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. Extensions to these methods, such as allowing for variants to be correlated, can be chosen if appropriate. Graphical commands allow summarized data to be displayed in an interactive graph, or the plotting of causal estimates from multiple methods, for comparison. Although the main method of data entry is directly by the user, there is also an option for allowing summarized data to be incorporated from the PhenoScanner database of genotype—phenotype associations. We hope to develop this feature in future versions of the package. The R software environment is available for download from [https://www.r-project.org/]. The MendelianRandomization package can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) within R, or directly from [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MendelianRandomization/]. Both R and the MendelianRandomization package are released under GNU General Public Licenses (GPL-2{\textbar}GPL-3).},

	abstract = {Current methods for Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses are restricted to single SNP instruments, and cannot reliably infer causality with instruments that are mostly weak and pleiotropic. We describe methods to overcome these limitations: key innovations are construction of scalar instruments from multiple SNPs, use of a regularized horseshoe prior, and hypothesis tests based on the marginal likelihood of the causal effect parameter. To demonstrate the approach, we constructed genotypic instruments from unlinked trans-pQTLs detected in two large GWAS studies of plasma proteins, and tested the top 20 genes for which the aggregated effects of the instruments was associated with type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank cohort. The only protein with clear evidence of a causal effect on type 2 diabetes was adiponectin, encoded by ADIPOQ: standardized log odds ratio -0.34 (95\% CI -0.44 to -0.24) using UK Biobank instruments. These results have implications for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Where the exposure under study is expression of a gene, restricting the instruments to cis-acting variants is likely to miss causal effects. Tests based on the marginal likelihood should supersede other methods of testing for causality in the presence of pleiotropy.},

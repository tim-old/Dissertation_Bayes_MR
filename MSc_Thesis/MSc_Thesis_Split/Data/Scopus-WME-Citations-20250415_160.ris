AB  - Background & Aims: Human studies examining associations between circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and colorectal cancer risk have reported inconsistent results. We conducted complementary serologic and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to determine whether alterations in circulating levels of IGF1 or IGFBP3 are associated with colorectal cancer development. Methods: Serum levels of IGF1 were measured in blood samples collected from 397,380 participants from the UK Biobank, from 2006 through 2010. Incident cancer cases and cancer cases recorded first in death certificates were identified through linkage to national cancer and death registries. Complete follow-up was available through March 31, 2016. For the MR analyses, we identified genetic variants associated with circulating levels of IGF1 and IGFBP3. The association of these genetic variants with colorectal cancer was examined with 2-sample MR methods using genome-wide association study consortia data (52,865 cases with colorectal cancer and 46,287 individuals without [controls]) Results: After a median follow-up period of 7.1 years, 2665 cases of colorectal cancer were recorded. In a multivariable-adjusted model, circulating level of IGF1 associated with colorectal cancer risk (hazard ratio per 1 standard deviation increment of IGF1, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.17). Similar associations were found by sex, follow-up time, and tumor subsite. In the MR analyses, a 1 standard deviation increment in IGF1 level, predicted based on genetic factors, was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer risk (odds ratio 1.08; 95% CI 1.03–1.12; P = 3.3 × 10–4). Level of IGFBP3, predicted based on genetic factors, was associated with colorectal cancer risk (odds ratio per 1 standard deviation increment, 1.12; 95% CI 1.06–1.18; P = 4.2 × 10–5). Colorectal cancer risk was associated with only 1 variant in the IGFBP3 gene region (rs11977526), which also associated with anthropometric traits and circulating level of IGF2. Conclusions: In an analysis of blood samples from almost 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank, we found an association between circulating level of IGF1 and colorectal cancer. Using genetic data from 52,865 cases with colorectal cancer and 46,287 controls, a higher level of IGF1, determined by genetic factors, was associated with colorectal cancer. Further studies are needed to determine how this signaling pathway might contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. © 2020 AGA Institute

AB  - Objectives: To examine whether educational attainment and intelligence have causal effects on risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), independently of each other. Design: Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effects of education on intelligence and vice versa, and the total and independent causal effects of both education and intelligence on AD risk. Participants: 17 008 AD cases and 37 154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) consortium. Main outcome measure: Odds ratio (OR) of AD per standardized deviation increase in years of schooling (SD = 3.6 years) and intelligence (SD = 15 points on intelligence test). Results: There was strong evidence of a causal, bidirectional relationship between intelligence and educational attainment, with the magnitude of effect being similar in both directions [OR for intelligence on education = 0.51 SD units, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49, 0.54; OR for education on intelligence = 0.57 SD units, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.66]. Similar overall effects were observed for both educational attainment and intelligence on AD risk in the univariable MR analysis; with each SD increase in years of schooling and intelligence, odds of AD were, on average, 37% (95% CI: 23-49%) and 35% (95% CI: 25-43%) lower, respectively. There was little evidence from the multivariable MR analysis that educational attainment affected AD risk once intelligence was taken into account (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.68-1.93), but intelligence affected AD risk independently of educational attainment to a similar magnitude observed in the univariate analysis (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.44-0.88). Conclusions: There is robust evidence for an independent, causal effect of intelligence in lowering AD risk. The causal effect of educational attainment on AD risk is likely to be mediated by intelligence.  © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Leisure sedentary behaviours are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but whether this relationship is causal is unknown. The aim of this study is to identify genetic determinants associated with leisure sedentary behaviours and to estimate the potential causal effect on coronary artery disease (CAD). Genome wide association analyses of leisure television watching, leisure computer use and driving behaviour in the UK Biobank identify 145, 36 and 4 genetic loci (P < 1×10−8), respectively. High genetic correlations are observed between sedentary behaviours and neurological traits, including education and body mass index (BMI). Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis estimates a causal effect between 1.5 hour increase in television watching and CAD (OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.25–1.66, P = 5.63 × 10−07), that is partially independent of education and BMI in multivariable MR analyses. This study finds independent observational and genetic support for the hypothesis that increased sedentary behaviour by leisure television watching is a risk factor for CAD. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: There is evidence that education protects against cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether such an effect is independent of cognition. Methods: We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate the effect of education and cognition, respectively, on risk of CHD and ischaemic stroke. Additionally, we used multivariable MR to adjust for the effects of cognition and education in the respective analyses to measure the effects of these traits independently of each other. Results: In unadjusted MR, there was evidence that education is causally associated with both CHD and stroke risk [CHD: odds ratio (OR) 0.65 per 1-standard deviation (SD; 3.6 years) increase in education; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.70, stroke: OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.69-0.86]. This effect persisted after adjusting for cognition in multivariable MR (CHD: OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65-0.89, stroke OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.92). Cognition had an apparent effect on CHD risk in unadjusted MR (OR per 1-SD increase 0.80; 95% CI 0.74-0.85), however after adjusting for education this was no longer observed (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.86-1.25). Cognition did not have any notable effect on the risk of developing ischaemic stroke, with (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.87-1.08) or without adjustment for education (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.79-1.36). Conclusions: This study provides evidence to support that education protects against CHD and ischaemic stroke risk independently of cognition, but does not provide evidence to support that cognition protects against CHD and stroke risk independently of education. These findings could have implications for education and health policy. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the causal effect of childhood BMI on adult cardiometabolic diseases using a Mendelian randomization analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used15single nucleotide polymorphisms asinstrumental variables for childhood BMI to test the causal effect of childhood BMI on cardiometabolic diseases using summary-level data from consortia. RESULTS: We found that a 1-SD increase in childhood BMI (kg/m2) was associated with an 83% increase in risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.83 [95% CI 1.46, 2.30]; P = 2.5 × 10-7) and a 28% increase in risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.17, 1.39]; P = 2.1 × 10-7)atthe Bonferroni-adjusted level ofsignificance (P< 0.017) in adults. In addition, a 1-SD increase in childhood BMI was associated with a 0.587-SD increase in adulthood BMI (kg/m2), a 0.062-SD increase in hip circumference (cm), a 0.602-SD increase in waist circumference (cm), a 0.111 pmol/L increase in log fasting insulin, a 0.068 increase in log-transformed HOMA of ß-cell function (%), a 0.126 increase in log-transformed HOMA of insulin resistance (%), and a 0.109-SD increase in triglyceride (mg/dL) but a 0.138-SD decrease in HDL (mg/dL) in adults at the Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance (P < 0.0026). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic predisposition to higher childhood BMI was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and CAD in adult life. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between childhood BMI and these outcomes. © 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Objective: Observational studies have shown the association between iron status and osteoarthritis (OA). However, due to difficulties of determining sequential temporality, their causal association is still elusive. Based on the summary data of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of a large-scale population, this study explored the genetic causal association between iron status and OA. Methods: First, we took a series of quality control steps to select eligible instrumental SNPs which were strongly associated with exposure. The genetic causal association between iron status and OA was analyzed using the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode methods were used for analysis. The results were mainly based on IVW (random effects), followed by sensitivity analysis. IVW and MR-Egger were used for heterogeneity testing. MR-Egger was also used for pleiotropy testing. Leave-one-SNP-out analysis was used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with potential impact. Maximum likelihood, penalized weighted median, and IVW (fixed effects) were performed to further validate the reliability of results. Results: IVW results showed that transferrin saturation had a positive causal association with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), hip osteoarthritis (HOA) and KOA or HOA (p < 0.05, OR > 1), and there was a negative causal association between transferrin and HOA and KOA or HOA (p < 0.05, OR < 1). The results of heterogeneity test showed that our IVW analysis results were basically free of heterogeneity (p > 0.05). The results of the pleiotropy test showed that there was no pleiotropy in our IVW analysis (p > 0.05). The analysis results of maximum likelihood, penalized weighted median and IVW (fixed effects) were consistent with our IVW results. No genetic causal association was found between serum iron and ferritin and OA. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of the causal association between iron status and OA, which provides novel insights to the genetic research of OA. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Methods have been developed for Mendelian randomization that can obtain consistent causal estimates under weaker assumptions than the standard instrumental variable assumptions. The median-based estimator and MR-Egger are examples of such methods. However, these methods can be sensitive to genetic variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. Such heterogeneity may arise from over-dispersion in the causal estimates, or specific variants with outlying causal estimates. In this paper, we develop three extensions to robust methods for Mendelian randomization with summarized data: 1) robust regression (MM-estimation); 2) penalized weights; and 3) Lasso penalization. Methods using these approaches are considered in two applied examples: one where there is evidence of overdispersion in the causal estimates (the causal effect of body mass index on schizophrenia risk), and the other containing outliers (the causal effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on Alzheimer’s disease risk). Through an extensive simulation study, we demonstrate that robust regression applied to the inverse-variance weighted method with penalized weights is a worthwhile additional sensitivity analysis for Mendelian randomization to provide robustness to variants with outlying causal estimates. The results from the applied examples and simulation study highlight the importance of using methods that make different assumptions to assess the robustness of findings from Mendelian randomization investigations with multiple genetic variants. © 2019 Rees et al.

AB  - Background: Previously, observational studies have identified associations between higher levels of dietary-derived antioxidants and lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas randomized clinical trials showed no reduction in CHD risk following antioxidant supplementation. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate possible causal associations between dietary-derived circulating antioxidants and primary CHD risk using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms for circulating antioxidants (vitamins E and C, retinol, β-carotene, and lycopene), assessed as absolute levels and metabolites, were retrieved from the published data and were used as genetic instrumental variables. Summary statistics for gene-CHD associations were obtained from 3 databases: the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortium (60,801 cases; 123,504 control subjects), UK Biobank (25,306 cases; 462,011 control subjects), and FinnGen study (7,123 cases; 89,376 control subjects). For each exposure, MR analyses were performed per outcome database and were subsequently meta-analyzed. Results: Among an analytic sample of 768,121 individuals (93,230 cases), genetically predicted circulating antioxidants were not causally associated with CHD risk. For absolute antioxidants, the odds ratio for CHD ranged between 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63 to 1.41) for retinol and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.10) for β-carotene per unit increase in ln-transformed antioxidant values. For metabolites, the odds ratio ranged between 0.93 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.06) for γ-tocopherol and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.08) for ascorbate per 10-fold increase in metabolite levels. Conclusions: Evidence from our study did not support a protective effect of genetic predisposition to high dietary-derived antioxidant levels on CHD risk. Therefore, it is unlikely that taking antioxidants to increase blood antioxidants levels will have a clinical benefit for the prevention of primary CHD. © 2021 American College of Cardiology Foundation

AB  - Liver dysfunction and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are consistently associated. However, it is currently unknown whether liver dysfunction contributes to, results from, or is merely correlated with T2D due to confounding. We used Mendelian randomization to investigate the presence and direction of any causal relation between liver function and T2D risk including up to 64,094 T2D case and 607,012 control subjects. Several biomarkers were used as proxies of liver function (i.e., alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and g-glutamyl transferase [GGT]). Genetic variants strongly associated with each liver function marker were used to investigate the effect of liver function on T2D risk. In addition, genetic variants strongly associated with T2D risk and with fasting insulin were used to investigate the effect of predisposition to T2D and insulin resistance, respectively, on liver function. Genetically predicted higher circulating ALT and AST were related to increased risk of T2D. There was a modest negative association of genetically predicted ALP with T2D risk and no evidence of association between GGT and T2D risk. Genetic predisposition to higher fasting insulin, but not to T2D, was related to increased circulating ALT. Since circulating ALT and AST are markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), these findings provide some support for insulin resistance resulting in NAFLD, which in turn increases T2D risk. © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - At the time of cancer diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) is inversely correlated with lung cancer risk, which may reflect reverse causality and confounding due to smoking behavior. We used two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate causal relationships of BMI and smoking behaviors on lung cancer and histological subtypes based on an aggregated genome-wide association studies (GWASs) analysis of lung cancer in 29 266 cases and 56 450 controls. We observed a positive causal effect for high BMI on occurrence of small-cell lung cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24-2.06, P = 2.70 × 10−4). After adjustment of smoking behaviors using multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR), a direct causal effect on small cell lung cancer (ORMVMR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.06-1.55, PMVMR =.011), and an inverse effect on lung adenocarcinoma (ORMVMR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77-0.96, PMVMR =.008) were observed. A weak increased risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma was observed for higher BMI in univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR) analysis (ORUVMR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.01-1.40, PUVMR =.036), but this effect disappeared after adjustment of smoking (ORMVMR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.90-1.16, PMVMR =.746). These results highlight the histology-specific impact of BMI on lung carcinogenesis and imply mediator role of smoking behaviors in the association between BMI and lung cancer. © 2020 UICC

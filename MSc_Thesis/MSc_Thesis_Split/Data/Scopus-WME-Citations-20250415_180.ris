AB  - Growing evidence suggests that relative carbohydrate intake affects depression; however, the association between carbohydrates and depression remains controversial. To test this, we performed a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genetic variants associated with relative carbohydrate intake (N = 268,922) and major depressive disorder (N = 143,265) from the largest available genome-wide association studies. MR evidence suggested a causal relationship between higher relative carbohydrate intake and lower depression risk (odds ratio, 0.42 for depression per one-standard-deviation increment in relative carbohydrate intake; 95% confidence interval, 0.28 to 0.62; P = 1.49 × 10−5). Multivariable MR indicated that the protective effect of relative carbohydrate intake on depression persisted after conditioning on other diet compositions. The mediation analysis via two-step MR showed that this effect was partly mediated by body mass index, with a mediated proportion of 15.4% (95% confidence interval, 6.7% to 24.1%). These findings may inform prevention strategies and interventions directed towards relative carbohydrate intake and depression. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Background: Whether a modestly elevated homocysteine level is causally associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease remains unestablished. We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to assess the associations of circulating total homocysteine (tHcy) and B vitamin levels with cardiovascular diseases in the general population. Methods: Independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tHcy (n = 14), folate (n = 2), vitamin B6 (n = 1), and vitamin B12 (n = 14) at the genome-wide significance level were selected as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for 12 cardiovascular endpoints were obtained from genetic consortia, the UK Biobank study, and the FinnGen consortium. Results: Higher genetically predicted circulating tHcy levels were associated with an increased risk of stroke. For each one standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03, 1.21; p = 0.008) for any stroke, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.51; p = 0.013) for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03, 1.21; p = 0.011) for ischemic stroke. Higher genetically predicted folate levels were associated with decreased risk of coronary artery disease (ORSD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78, 1.00, p = 0.049) and any stroke (ORSD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76, 0.97, p = 0.012). Genetically predicted increased vitamin B6 levels were associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (ORSD, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81, 0.97, p = 0.009). None of these associations persisted after multiple testing correction. There was no association between genetically predicted vitamin B12 and cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: This study reveals suggestive evidence that B vitamin therapy and lowering of tHcy may reduce the risk of stroke, particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Few studies have explored the impact of rare variants (minor allele frequency < 1%) on highly heritable plasma metabolites identified in metabolomic screens. The Finnish population provides an ideal opportunity for such explorations, given the multiple bottlenecks and expansions that have shaped its history, and the enrichment for many otherwise rare alleles that has resulted. Here, we report genetic associations for 1391 plasma metabolites in 6136 men from the late-settlement region of Finland. We identify 303 novel association signals, more than one third at variants rare or enriched in Finns. Many of these signals identify genes not previously implicated in metabolite genome-wide association studies and suggest mechanisms for diseases and disease-related traits. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background Studies have found sleeping behaviors, such as sleep duration, to be associated with kidney function and cardiovascular disease risk. However, whether short or long sleep duration is a causative factor for kidney function impairment has been rarely studied. Methods We studied data from participants aged 40–69 years in the UK Biobank prospective cohort, including 25,605 self-reporting short-duration sleep (,6 hours per 24 hours), 404,550 reporting intermediate-duration sleep (6–8 hours), and 35,659 reporting long-duration sleep ($9 hours) in the clinical analysis. Using logistic regression analysis, we investigated the observational association between the sleep duration group and prevalent CKD stages 3–5, analyzed by logistic regression analysis. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis involving 321,260 White British individuals using genetic instruments (genetic variants linked with short- or long-duration sleep behavior as instrumental variables). We performed genetic risk score analysis as a one-sample MR and extended the finding with a two-sample MR analysis with CKD outcome information from the independent CKDGen Consortium genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Results Short or long sleep duration clinically associated with higher prevalence of CKD compared with intermediate duration. The genetic risk score for short (but not long) sleep was significantly related to CKD (per unit reflecting a two-fold increase in the odds of the phenotype; adjusted odds ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.60). Two-sample MR analysis demonstrated causal effects of short sleep duration on CKD by the inverse variance weighted method, supported by causal estimates from MR-Egger regression. Conclusions These findings support an adverse effect of a short sleep duration on kidney function. Clinicians may encourage patients to avoid short-duration sleeping behavior to reduce CKD risk.

AB  -                              Background: Earlier puberty is widely linked with future obesity and cardiometabolic disease. We examined whether age at puberty onset likely influences adiposity and cardiometabolic traits independent of childhood adiposity. Methods and findings: One-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses were conducted on up to 3,611 white-European female and male offspring from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort recruited at birth via mothers between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992. Time-sensitive exposures were age at menarche and age at voice breaking. Outcomes measured at age 18 y were body mass index (BMI), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry–based fat and lean mass indices, blood pressure, and 230 cardiometabolic traits derived from targeted metabolomics (150 concentrations plus 80 ratios from nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] spectroscopy covering lipoprotein subclasses of cholesterol and triglycerides, amino acids, inflammatory glycoproteins, and others). Adjustment was made for pre-pubertal BMI measured at age 8 y. For negative control MR analyses, BMI and cardiometabolic trait measures taken at age 8 y (before puberty, and which therefore cannot be an outcome of puberty itself) were used. For replication analyses, 2-sample MR was conducted using summary genome-wide association study data on up to 322,154 adults for post-pubertal BMI, 24,925 adults for post-pubertal NMR cardiometabolic traits, and 13,848 children for pre-pubertal obesity (negative control). Like observational estimates, 1-sample MR estimates in ALSPAC using 351 polymorphisms for age at menarche (explaining 10.6% of variance) among 2,053 females suggested that later age at menarche (per year) was associated with −1.38 kg/m                             2                             of BMI at age 18 y (or −0.34 SD units, 95% CI −0.46, −0.23; P = 9.77 × 10                             −09                             ). This coefficient attenuated 10-fold upon adjustment for BMI at age 8 y, to −0.12 kg/m                             2                             (or −0.03 SDs, 95% CI −0.13, 0.07; P = 0.55). Associations with blood pressure were similar, but associations across other traits were small and inconsistent. In negative control MR analyses, later age at menarche was associated with −0.77 kg/m                             2                             of pre-pubertal BMI measured at age 8 y (or −0.39 SDs, 95% CI −0.50, −0.29; P = 6.28 × 10                             −13                             ), indicating that variants influencing menarche also influence BMI before menarche. Cardiometabolic trait associations were weaker and less consistent among males and both sexes combined. Higher BMI at age 8 y (per 1 kg/m                             2                             using 95 polymorphisms for BMI explaining 3.4% of variance) was associated with earlier menarche among 2,648 females (by −0.26 y, 95% CI −0.37, −0.16; P = 1.16 × 10                             −06                             ), likewise among males and both sexes combined. In 2-sample MR analyses using 234 polymorphisms and inverse variance weighted (IVW) regression, each year later age at menarche was associated with −0.81 kg/m                             2                             of adult BMI (or −0.17 SD units, 95% CI −0.21, −0.12; P = 4.00 × 10                             −15                             ). Associations were weaker with cardiometabolic traits. Using 202 polymorphisms, later menarche was associated with lower odds of childhood obesity (IVW-based odds ratio = 0.52 per year later, 95% CI 0.48, 0.57; P = 6.64 × 10                             −15                             ). Study limitations include modest sample sizes for 1-sample MR, lack of inference to non-white-European populations, potential selection bias through modest completion rates of puberty questionnaires, and likely disproportionate measurement error of exposures by sex. The cardiometabolic traits examined were heavily lipid-focused and did not include hormone-related traits such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors. Conclusions: Our results suggest that puberty timing has a small influence on adiposity and cardiometabolic traits and that preventive interventions should instead focus on reducing childhood adiposity.                          © 2018 Bell et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological studies have linked lifestyle, cardiometabolic, reproductive, developmental, and inflammatory factors to the risk of colorectal cancer. However, which specific factors affect risk and the strength of these effects are unknown. We aimed to examine the relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer. Methods: We used a random-effects model to examine the relationship between 39 potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer in 26 397 patients with colorectal cancer and 41 481 controls (ie, people without colorectal cancer). These population data came from a genome-wide association study of people of European ancestry, which was amended to exclude UK BioBank data. In the model, we used genetic variants as instruments via two-sample mendelian randomisation to limit bias from confounding and reverse causation. We calculated odds ratios per genetically predicted SD unit increase in each putative risk factor (ORSD) for colorectal cancer risk. We did mendelian randomisation Egger regressions to identify evidence of potential violations of mendelian randomisation assumptions. A Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p=1·3 × 10−3 was considered significant, and p values less than 0·05 were considered to be suggestive of an association. Findings: No putative risk factors were significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk after correction for multiple testing. However, suggestive associations with increased risk were noted for genetically predicted body fat percentage (ORSD 1·14 [95% CI 1·03–1·25]; p=0·0086), body-mass index (1·09 [1·01–1·17]; p=0·023), waist circumference (1·13 [1·02–1·26]; p=0·018), basal metabolic rate (1·10 [1·03–1·18]; p=0·0079), and concentrations of LDL cholesterol (1·14 [1·04–1·25]; p=0·0056), total cholesterol (1·09 [1·01–1·18]; p=0·025), circulating serum iron (1·17 [1·00–1·36]; p=0·049), and serum vitamin B12 (1·21 [1·04–1·42]; p=0·016), although potential pleiotropy among genetic variants used as instruments for vitamin B12 constrains the finding. A suggestive association was also noted between adult height and increased risk of colorectal cancer (ORSD 1·04 [95% CI 1·00–1·08]; p=0·032). Low blood selenium concentration had a suggestive association with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (ORSD 0·85 [95% CI 0·75–0·96]; p=0·0078) based on a single variant, as did plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 receptor subunit α (also based on a single variant; 0·98 [0·96–1·00]; p=0·035). Risk of colorectal cancer was not associated with any sex hormone or reproductive factor, serum calcium, or circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Interpretation: This analysis identified several modifiable targets for primary prevention of colorectal cancer, including lifestyle, obesity, and cardiometabolic factors, that should inform public health policy.

AB  - Background: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), two subtypes of IBD, are characterized by unique microbial signatures, respectively. However, it is unclear whether UC or CD has a specific causal relationship with gut microbiota. Objective: To investigate the potential causal associations between gut microbial genera and IBD, UC, or CD, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted. Materials and Methods: We obtained genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of gut microbiota and IBD, UC, or CD from published GWASs. Two-sample MR analyses were performed to identify potential causal gut microbial genera for IBD, UC, and CD using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to validate the robustness of the primary results of the MR analyses. Finally, a reverse MR analysis was performed to evaluate the possibility of reverse causation. Results: Combining the results from the primary and sensitivity analyses, six bacterial genera were associated with the risk of IBD, UC, or CD in the IVW method. Briefly, Eubacterium ventriosum group was associated with a lower risk of IBD (P=0.011) and UC (P=1.00×10-4), whereas Coprococcus 2 was associated with a higher risk of IBD (P=0.022) and UC (P=0.007). In addition, we found a positive association between Oxalobacter with IBD (P=0.001) and CD (P=0.002), and Ruminococcaceae UCG014 with IBD (P=0.005) and CD (P=0.007). We also noticed a negative association between Enterorhabdus (P=0.044) and IBD, and between Lachnospiraceae UCG001 (P=0.023) and CD. We did not find causal effects of IBD, UC, or CD on these bacterial genera in the reverse MR analysis. Conclusion: This study expanded gut microbial genera that were causally associated with the risk of IBD, and also revealed specificity-gut microbial genera for UC or CD.

AB  - Mendelian randomization is a powerful tool for inferring the presence, or otherwise, of causal effects from observational data. However, the nature of genetic variants is such that pleiotropy remains a barrier to valid causal effect estimation. There are many options in the literature for pleiotropy robust methods when studying the effects of a single risk factor on an outcome. However, there are few pleiotropy robust methods in the multivariable setting, that is, when there are multiple risk factors of interest. In this article we introduce three methods which build on common approaches in the univariable setting: MVMR-Robust; MVMR-Median; and MVMR-Lasso. We discuss the properties of each of these methods and examine their performance in comparison to existing approaches in a simulation study. MVMR-Robust is shown to outperform existing outlier robust approaches when there are low levels of pleiotropy. MVMR-Lasso provides the best estimation in terms of mean squared error for moderate to high levels of pleiotropy, and can provide valid inference in a three sample setting. MVMR-Median performs well in terms of estimation across all scenarios considered, and provides valid inference up to a moderate level of pleiotropy. We demonstrate the methods in an applied example looking at the effects of intelligence, education and household income on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Excretion of albumin in urine, or albuminuria, is associated with the development of multiple cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, whether pathways leading to albuminuria are causal for cardiometabolic diseases is unclear. We addressed this question using a Mendelian randomization framework in the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort. We first performed a genome-wide association study for albuminuria in 382,500 individuals and identified 32 new albuminuria loci. We constructed albuminuria genetic risk scores and tested for association with cardiometabolic diseases. Genetically elevated albuminuria was strongly associated with increased risk of hypertension (1.38 OR; 95% CI, 1.27–1.50 per 1 SD predicted increase in albuminuria, p = 7.01 × 10−14). We then examined bidirectional associations of albuminuria with blood pressure which suggested that genetically elevated albuminuria led to higher blood pressure (2.16 mmHg systolic blood pressure; 95% CI, 1.51–2.82 per 1 SD predicted increase in albuminuria, p = 1.22 × 10−10) and that genetically elevated blood pressure led to more albuminuria (0.005 SD; 95% CI 0.004–0.006 per 1 mmHg predicted increase in systolic blood pressure, p = 2.45 × 10−13). These results support the existence of a feed-forward loop between albuminuria and blood pressure and imply that albuminuria could increase risk of cardiovascular disease through blood pressure. Moreover, they suggest therapies that target albuminuria-increasing processes could have antihypertensive effects that are amplified through inhibition of this feed-forward loop. © 2018

AB  - Background: Recent clinical guidelines support intensive blood pressure treatment targets. However, observational data suggest that excessive diastolic blood pressure (DBP) lowering might increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), reflecting a J- or U-shaped relationship. Methods: We analyzed 47 407 participants from 5 cohorts (median age, 60 years). First, to corroborate previous observational analyses, we used traditional statistical methods to test the shape of association between DBP and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Second, we created polygenic risk scores of DBP and systolic blood pressure and generated linear Mendelian randomization (MR) estimates for the effect of DBP on CVD. Third, using novel nonlinear MR approaches, we evaluated for nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between DBP and CVD events. Comprehensive MR interrogation of DBP required us to also model systolic blood pressure, given that the 2 are strongly correlated. Results: Traditional observational analysis of our cohorts suggested a J-shaped association between DBP and MI. By contrast, linear MR analyses demonstrated an adverse effect of increasing DBP increments on CVD outcomes, including MI (MI hazard ratio, 1.07 per unit mm Hg increase in DBP; P<0.001). Furthermore, nonlinear MR analyses found no evidence for a J-shaped relationship; instead confirming that MI risk decreases consistently per unit decrease in DBP, even among individuals with low values of baseline DBP. Conclusions: In this analysis of the genetic effect of DBP, we found no evidence for a nonlinear J- or U-shaped relationship between DBP and adverse CVD outcomes; including MI. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

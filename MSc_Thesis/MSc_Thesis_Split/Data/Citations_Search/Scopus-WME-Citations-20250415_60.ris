AB  - Background: Recently, the association between inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) and BMD has attracted great interest in the research community. However, the results of the published epidemiological observational studies on the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and BMD are still inconclusive. Here, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the causal link between inflammatory bowel disease and level of BMD using publically available GWAS summary statistics. Methods: A series of quality control steps were taken in our analysis to select eligible instrumental SNPs which were strongly associated with exposure. To make the conclusions more robust and reliable, we utilized several robust analytical methods (inverse-variance weighting, MR-PRESSO method, mode-based estimate method, weighted median, MR-Egger regression, and MR.RAPS method) that are based on different assumptions of two-sample MR analysis. The MR-Egger intercept test, Cochran’s Q test, and “leave-one-out” sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate the horizontal pleiotropy, heterogeneities, and stability of these genetic variants on BMD. Outlier variants identified by the MR-PRESSO outlier test were removed step-by-step to reduce heterogeneity and the effect of horizontal pleiotropy. Results: Our two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis with two groups of exposure GWAS summary statistics and four groups of outcome GWAS summary statistics suggested a definitively causal effect of genetically predicted ulcerative colitis on TB-BMD and FA-BMD but not on FN-BMD or LS-BMD (after Bonferroni correction), and we merely determined a causal effect of Crohn’s disease on FN-BMD but not on the others, which was somewhat inconsistent with many published observational researches. The causal effect of inflammatory bowel disease on TB-BMD was significant and robust but not on FA-BMD, FN-BMD, and LS-BMD, which might result from the cumulative effect of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease on BMDs. Conclusions: Our Mendelian randomization analysis supported the causal effect of ulcerative colitis on TB-BMD and FA-BMD. As to Crohn’s disease, only the definitively causal effect of it on decreased FN-BMD was observed. Updated MR analysis is warranted to confirm our findings when a more advanced method to get less biased estimates and better precision or GWAS summary data with more ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease patients was available. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Estimates from Mendelian randomization studies of unrelated individuals can be biased due to uncontrolled confounding from familial effects. Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization analyses and use simulation studies to show that family-based analyses can reduce such biases. We illustrate empirically how familial effects can affect estimates using data from 61,008 siblings from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and UK Biobank and replicated our findings using 222,368 siblings from 23andMe. Both Mendelian randomization estimates using unrelated individuals and within family methods reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while Mendelian randomization estimates from samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects were strongly attenuated in within-family Mendelian randomization analyses. Our findings indicate the necessity of controlling for population structure and familial effects in Mendelian randomization studies. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Visceral adipose tissue (VAT)—fat stored around the internal organs—has been suggested as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease1–3, as well as all-cause, cardiovascular-specific and cancer-specific mortality4,5. Yet, the contribution of genetics to VAT, as well as its disease-related effects, are largely unexplored due to the requirement for advanced imaging technologies to accurately measure VAT. Here, we develop sex-stratified, nonlinear prediction models (coefficient of determination = 0.76; typical 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74–0.78) for VAT mass using the UK Biobank cohort. We performed a genome-wide association study for predicted VAT mass and identified 102 novel visceral adiposity loci. Predicted VAT mass was associated with increased risk of hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and Mendelian randomization analysis showed visceral fat to be a causal risk factor for all four diseases. In particular, a large difference in causal effect between the sexes was found for type 2 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 7.34 (95% CI = 4.48–12.0) in females and an odds ratio of 2.50 (95% CI = 1.98–3.14) in males. Our findings bolster the role of visceral adiposity as a potentially independent risk factor, in particular for type 2 diabetes in Caucasian females. Independent validation in other cohorts is necessary to determine whether the findings can translate to other ethnicities, or outside the UK. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Epigenetics plays a key role in cellular development and function. Alterations to the epigenome are thought to capture and mediate the effects of genetic and environmental risk factors on complex disease. Currently, DNA methylation is the only epigenetic mark that can be measured reliably and genome-wide in large numbers of samples. This Review discusses some of the key statistical challenges and algorithms associated with drawing inferences from DNA methylation data, including cell-type heterogeneity, feature selection, reverse causation and system-level analyses that require integration with other data types such as gene expression, genotype, transcription factor binding and other epigenetic information. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Positive associations between inflammatory biomarkers and risk of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, have been reported in observational studies. However, conventional observational studies are prone to bias, such as reverse causation and residual confounding, thus limiting our understanding of the effect (if any) of inflammatory biomarkers on schizophrenia risk. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether inflammatory biomarkers have an effect on the risk of developing schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-sample mendelian randomization study using genetic variants associated with inflammatory biomarkers as instrumental variables to improve inference. Summary association results from large consortia of candidate gene or genome-wide association studies, including several epidemiologic studies with different designs, were used. Gene-inflammatory biomarker associations were estimated in pooled samples ranging from 1645 to more than 80 000 individuals, while gene-schizophrenia associations were estimated in more than 30 000 cases and more than 45 000 ancestry-matched controls. In most studies included in the consortia, participants were of European ancestry, and the prevalence of men was approximately 50%. All studies were conducted in adults, with a wide age range (18 to 80 years). EXPOSURES Genetically elevated circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of developing schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders were included as cases. Given that many studies contributed to the analyses, different diagnostic procedures were used. RESULTS The pooled odds ratio estimate using 18 CRP genetic instruments was 0.90 (random effects 95%CI, 0.84-0.97; P = .005) per 2-fold increment in CRP levels; consistent results were obtained using different mendelian randomization methods and a more conservative set of instruments. The odds ratio for sIL-6R was 1.06 (95%CI, 1.01-1.12; P = .02) per 2-fold increment. Estimates for IL-1Ra were inconsistent among instruments, and pooled estimates were imprecise and centered on the null. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Under mendelian randomization assumptions, our findings suggest a protective effect of CRP and a risk-increasing effect of sIL-6R (potentially mediated at least in part by CRP) on schizophrenia risk. It is possible that such effects are a result of increased susceptibility to early life infection. © 2017 Hartwig F et al.

AB  - Transcriptome-wide association studies using predicted expression have identified thousands of genes whose locally regulated expression is associated with complex traits and diseases. In this work, we show that linkage disequilibrium induces significant gene–trait associations at non-causal genes as a function of the expression quantitative trait loci weights used in expression prediction. We introduce a probabilistic framework that models correlation among transcriptome-wide association study signals to assign a probability for every gene in the risk region to explain the observed association signal. Importantly, our approach remains accurate when expression data for causal genes are not available in the causal tissue by leveraging expression prediction from other tissues. Our approach yields credible sets of genes containing the causal gene at a nominal confidence level (for example, 90%) that can be used to prioritize genes for functional assays. We illustrate our approach by using an integrative analysis of lipid traits, where our approach prioritizes genes with strong evidence for causality. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - Reproductive longevity is essential for fertility and influences healthy ageing in women1,2, but insights into its underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Problematic alcohol use (PAU) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies have identified PAU risk genes, the genetic architecture of this trait is not fully understood. We conducted a proxy-phenotype meta-analysis of PAU, combining alcohol use disorder and problematic drinking, in 435,563 European-ancestry individuals. We identified 29 independent risk variants, 19 of them novel. PAU was genetically correlated with 138 phenotypes, including substance use and psychiatric traits. Phenome-wide polygenic risk score analysis in an independent biobank sample (BioVU, n = 67,589) confirmed the genetic correlations between PAU and substance use and psychiatric disorders. Genetic heritability of PAU was enriched in brain and in conserved and regulatory genomic regions. Mendelian randomization suggested causal effects on liability to PAU of substance use, psychiatric status, risk-taking behavior and cognitive performance. In summary, this large PAU meta-analysis identified novel risk loci and revealed genetic relationships with numerous other traits. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

AB  - With the advent of very large scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs), the promise of Mendelian randomization (MR) has begun to be fulfilled. However, whilst GWASs have provided essential information on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with modifiable risk factors needed for MR, the availability of large numbers of SNP instruments raises issues of how best to use this information and how to deal with potential problems such as pleiotropy. Here we provide commentary on some of the recent advances in the MR analysis, including an overview of the different genetic architectures that are being uncovered for a variety of modifiable risk factors and how users ought to take that into consideration when designing MR studies. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Evidence from observational studies and clinical trials suggests that the gut microbiota is associated with cancer. However, the causal association between gut microbiota and cancer remains to be determined. Methods: We first identified two sets of gut microbiota based on phylum, class, order, family, and genus level information, and cancer data were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS project. We then performed two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) to determine whether the gut microbiota is causally associated with eight cancer types. Furthermore, we performed a bi-directional MR analysis to examine the direction of the causal relations. Results: We identified 11 causal relationships between genetic liability in the gut microbiome and cancer, including those involving the genus Bifidobacterium. We found 17 strong associations between genetic liability in the gut microbiome and cancer. Moreover, we found 24 associations between genetic liability in the gut microbiome and cancer using multiple datasets. Conclusions: Our MR analysis revealed that the gut microbiota was causally associated with cancers and may be useful in providing new insights for further mechanistic and clinical studies of microbiota-mediated cancer. © 2023, The Author(s).

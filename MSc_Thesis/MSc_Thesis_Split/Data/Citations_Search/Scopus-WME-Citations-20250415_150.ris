AB  - Objective: To systematically investigate causal relationships between obesity and cerebrovascular disease and the extent to which hypertension and hyperglycemia mediate the effect of obesity on cerebrovascular disease. Methods: We used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies for body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and multiple cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. We explored causal associations with 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) accounting for genetic covariation between BMI and WHR, and we assessed what proportion of the association between obesity and cerebrovascular disease was mediated by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and blood glucose levels, respectively. Results: Genetic predisposition to higher BMI did not increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. In contrast, for each 10% increase in WHR there was a 75% increase (95% confidence interval [CI] = 44–113%) in risk for large artery ischemic stroke, a 57% (95% CI = 29–91%) increase in risk for small vessel ischemic stroke, a 197% increase (95% CI = 59–457%) in risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, and an increase in white matter hyperintensity volume (β = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.01–0.21). These WHR associations persisted after adjusting for genetic determinants of BMI. Approximately one-tenth of the observed effect of WHR was mediated by SBP for ischemic stroke (proportion mediated: 12%, 95% CI = 4–20%), but no evidence of mediation was found for average blood glucose. Interpretation: Abdominal adiposity may trigger causal pathological processes, partially independent from blood pressure and totally independent from glucose levels, that lead to cerebrovascular disease. Potential targets of these pathological processes could represent novel therapeutic opportunities for stroke. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:516–524. © 2020 American Neurological Association

AB  - OBJECTIVE Higher plasma vitamin C levels are associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk, but whether this association is causal is uncertain. To investigate this, we studied the association of genetically predicted plasma vitamin C with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted genome-wide association studies of plasma vitamin C among 52,018 individuals of European ancestry to discover novel genetic variants. We performed Mendelian randomization analyses to estimate the association of genetically predicted differences in plasma vitamin C with type 2 diabetes in up to 80,983 case participants and 842,909 noncase participants. We compared this estimate with the observational association between plasma vitamin C and incident type 2 diabetes, including 8,133 case participants and 11,073 noncase participants. RESULTS We identified 11 genomic regions associated with plasma vitamin C (P < 5 ☓ 10-8), with the strongest signal at SLC23A1, and 10 novel genetic loci including SLC23A3, CHPT1, BCAS3, SNRPF, RER1, MAF, GSTA5, RGS14, AKT1, and FADS1. Plasma vitamin C was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio per SD 0.88; 95% CI 0.82, 0.94), but there was no association between genetically predicted plasma vitamin C (excluding FADS1 variant due to its apparent pleiotropic effect) and type 2 diabetes (1.03; 95% CI 0.96, 1.10). CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate discordance between biochemically measured and genetically predicted plasma vitamin C levels in the association with type 2 diabetes among European populations. The null Mendelian randomization findings provide no strong evidence to suggest the use of vitamin C supplementation for type 2 diabetes prevention. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Background: Higher adiposity increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but whether this relationship varies by anatomical sub-site or by sex is unclear. Further, the metabolic alterations mediating the effects of adiposity on CRC are not fully understood. Methods: We examined sex- and site-specific associations of adiposity with CRC risk and whether adiposity-associated metabolites explain the associations of adiposity with CRC. Genetic variants from genome-wide association studies of body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR, unadjusted for BMI; N = 806,810), and 123 metabolites from targeted nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (N = 24,925), were used as instruments. Sex-combined and sex-specific Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted for BMI and WHR with CRC risk (58,221 cases and 67,694 controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium, Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary Study, and Colon Cancer Family Registry). Sex-combined MR was conducted for BMI and WHR with metabolites, for metabolites with CRC, and for BMI and WHR with CRC adjusted for metabolite classes in multivariable models. Results: In sex-specific MR analyses, higher BMI (per 4.2 kg/m2) was associated with 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08, 1.38) times higher CRC odds among men (inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) model); among women, higher BMI (per 5.2 kg/m2) was associated with 1.09 (95% CI = 0.97, 1.22) times higher CRC odds. WHR (per 0.07 higher) was more strongly associated with CRC risk among women (IVW OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.43) than men (IVW OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.81, 1.36). BMI or WHR was associated with 104/123 metabolites at false discovery rate-corrected P ≤ 0.05; several metabolites were associated with CRC, but not in directions that were consistent with the mediation of positive adiposity-CRC relations. In multivariable MR analyses, associations of BMI and WHR with CRC were not attenuated following adjustment for representative metabolite classes, e.g., the univariable IVW OR for BMI with CRC was 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00, 1.26), and this became 1.11 (95% CI = 0.99, 1.26) when adjusting for cholesterol in low-density lipoprotein particles. Conclusions: Our results suggest that higher BMI more greatly raises CRC risk among men, whereas higher WHR more greatly raises CRC risk among women. Adiposity was associated with numerous metabolic alterations, but none of these explained associations between adiposity and CRC. More detailed metabolomic measures are likely needed to clarify the mechanistic pathways. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - IMPORTANCE Risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are largely unknown, which has hampered the development of nonsurgical treatments to alter the natural history of disease. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between lipid-Associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and AAA risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Genetic risk scores, composed of lipid trait-associated SNPs, were constructed and tested for their association with AAA using conventional (inverse-variance weighted) mendelian randomization (MR) and data from international AAA genome-wide association studies. Sensitivity analyses to account for potential genetic pleiotropy included MR-Egger and weighted median MR, and multivariable MR method was used to test the independent association of lipids with AAA risk. The association between AAA and SNPs in loci that can act as proxies for drug targets was also assessed. Data collection took place between January 9, 2015, and January 4, 2016. Data analysis was conducted between January 4, 2015, and December 31, 2016. EXPOSURES Genetic elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The association between genetic risk scores of lipid-Associated SNPs and AAA risk, as well as the association between SNPs in lipid drug targets (HMGCR, CETP, and PCSK9) and AAA risk. RESULTS Up to 4914 cases and 48 002 controls were included in our analysis. A 1-SD genetic elevation of LDL-C was associated with increased AAA risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.66; 95%CI, 1.41-1.96; P = 1.1 × 10-9). For HDL-C, a 1-SD increase was associated with reduced AAA risk (OR, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.55-0.82; P = 8.3 × 10-5), whereas a 1-SD increase in triglycerides was associated with increased AAA risk (OR, 1.69; 95%CI, 1.38-2.07; P = 5.2 × 10-7). In multivariable MR analysis and both MR-Egger and weighted median MR methods, the association of each lipid fraction with AAA risk remained largely unchanged. The LDL-C-reducing allele of rs12916 in HMGCR was associated with AAA risk (OR, 0.93; 95%CI, 0.89-0.98; P = .009). The HDL-C-raising allele of rs3764261 in CETP was associated with lower AAA risk (OR, 0.89; 95%CI, 0.85-0.94; P = 3.7 × 10-7). Finally, the LDL-C-lowering allele of rs11206510 in PCSK9 was weakly associated with a lower AAA risk (OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.88-1.00; P = .04), but a second independent LDL-C-lowering variant in PCSK9 (rs2479409) was not associated with AAA risk (OR, 0.97; 95%CI, 0.92-1.02; P = .28). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE TheMR analyses in this study lend support to the hypothesis that lipids play an important role in the etiology of AAA. Analyses of individual genetic variants used as proxies for drug targets support LDL-C lowering as a potential effective treatment strategy for preventing and managing AAA. © 2017 American Medical Association.

AB  - Intelligence and education are predictive of better physical and mental health, socioeconomic position (SEP), and longevity. However, these associations are insufficient to prove that intelligence and/or education cause these outcomes. Intelligence and education are phenotypically and genetically correlated, which makes it difficult to elucidate causal relationships. We used univariate and multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the total and direct effects of intelligence and educational attainment on mental and physical health, measures of socioeconomic position, and longevity. Both intelligence and education had beneficial total effects. Higher intelligence had positive direct effects on income and alcohol consumption, and negative direct effects on moderate and vigorous physical activity. Higher educational attainment had positive direct effects on income, alcohol consumption, and vigorous physical activity, and negative direct effects on smoking, BMI and sedentary behaviour. If the Mendelian randomization assumptions hold, these findings suggest that both intelligence and education affect health. © Davies et al.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide while the pathogenesis remains unclear. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have made great achievements in detecting disease-related genetic variants. However, functional information on the underlying biological processes is often lacking. Current reports propose the use of metabolic traits as functional intermediate phenotypes (the so-called genetically determined metabotypes or GDMs) to reveal the biological mechanisms of genetics in human diseases. Here we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis that uses GDMs to assess the causal effects of 486 human serum metabolites on 5 major psychiatric disorders, which respectively were schizophrenia (SCZ), major depression (MDD), bipolar disorder (BIP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Using genetic variants as proxies, our study has identified 137 metabolites linked to the risk of psychiatric disorders, including 2-methoxyacetaminophen sulfate, which affects SCZ (P = 1.7 × 10-5) and 1-docosahexaenoylglycerophosp hocholine, which affects ADHD (P = 5.6 × 10-5). Fourteen significant metabolic pathways involved in the 5 psychiatric disorders assessed were also detected, such as glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism for SCZ (P = .0238), Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis for both MDD (P = .0144) and ADHD (P = .0029). Our study provided novel insights into integrating metabolomics with genomics in order to understand the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of human diseases.  © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Context: Iron overload is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, iron overload and iron deficiency have both been associated with metabolic disorders in observational studies. Objective: Using mendelian randomization (MR), we assessed how genetically predicted systemic iron status affected T2D risk. Methods: A 2-sample MR analysis was used to obtain a causal estimate. We selected genetic variants strongly associated (P<5×10-8) with 4 biomarkers of systemic iron status from a study involving 48972 individuals performed by the Genetics of Iron Status consortium and applied these biomarkers to the T2D case-control study (74124 cases and 824006 controls) performed by the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis consortium. The simple median, weighted median, MR-Egger, MR analysis using mixture-model, weighted allele scores, and MR based on a Bayesian model averaging approaches were used for the sensitivity analysis. Results: Genetically instrumented serum iron (odds ratio [OR]: 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.12), ferritin (OR: 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.32), and transferrin saturation (OR: 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) were positively associated with T2D. In contrast, genetically instrumented transferrin, a marker of reduced iron status, was inversely associated with T2D (OR: 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96). Conclusion: Genetic evidence supports a causal link between increased systemic iron status and increased T2D risk. Further studies involving various ethnic backgrounds based on individual-level data and studies regarding the underlying mechanism are warranted for reducing the risk of T2D.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Interest in the interplay between host genetics and the gut microbiome in complex human diseases is increasing, with prior evidence mainly being derived from animal models. In addition, the shared and distinct microbiome features among complex human diseases remain largely unclear. Results: This analysis was based on a Chinese population with 1475 participants. We estimated the SNP-based heritability, which suggested that Desulfovibrionaceae and Odoribacter had significant heritability estimates (0.456 and 0.476, respectively). We performed a microbiome genome-wide association study to identify host genetic variants associated with the gut microbiome. We then conducted bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses to examine the potential causal associations between the gut microbiome and complex human diseases. We found that Saccharibacteria could potentially decrease the concentration of serum creatinine and increase the estimated glomerular filtration rate. On the other hand, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer, as predicted by host genetics, had potential causal effects on the abundance of some specific gut microbiota. For example, atrial fibrillation increased the abundance of Burkholderiales and Alcaligenaceae and decreased the abundance of Lachnobacterium, Bacteroides coprophilus, Barnesiellaceae, an undefined genus in the family Veillonellaceae and Mitsuokella. Further disease-microbiome feature analysis suggested that systemic lupus erythematosus and chronic myeloid leukaemia shared common gut microbiome features. Conclusions: These results suggest that different complex human diseases share common and distinct gut microbiome features, which may help reshape our understanding of disease aetiology in humans.

AB  - Mendelian randomization (MR) is increasingly used to make causal inferences in a wide range of fields, from drug development to etiologic studies. Causal inference in MR is possible because of the process of genetic inheritance from parents to offspring. Specifically, at gamete formation and conception, meiosis ensures random allocation to the offspring of one allele from each parent at each locus, and these are unrelated to most of the other inherited genetic variants. To date, most MR studies have used data from unrelated individuals. These studies assume that genotypes are independent of the environment across a sample of unrelated individuals, conditional on covariates. Here we describe potential sources of bias, such as transmission ratio distortion, selection bias, population stratification, dynastic effects and assortative mating that can induce spurious or biased SNP-phenotype associations. We explain how studies of related individuals such as sibling pairs or parent-offspring trios can be used to overcome some of these sources of bias, to provide potentially more reliable evidence regarding causal processes. The increasing availability of data from related individuals in large cohort studies presents an opportunity to both overcome some of these biases and also to evaluate familial environmental effects. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Understanding mediation is useful for identifying intermediates lying between an exposure and an outcome which, when intervened upon, will block (some or all of) the causal pathway between the exposure and outcome. Mediation approaches used in conventional epidemiology have been adapted to understanding the role of molecular intermediates in situations of high-dimensional omics data with varying degrees of success. In particular, the limitations of observational epidemiological study including confounding, reverse causation and measurement error can afflict conventional mediation approaches and may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding causal effects. Solutions to analysing mediation which overcome these problems include the use of instrumental variable methods such as Mendelian randomization, which may be applied to evaluate causality in increasingly complex networks of omics data. © The Author 2016.

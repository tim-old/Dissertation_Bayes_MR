# Abstract

## Background

Mendelian randomisation (MR) uses data from observational genetic studies to support causal inference between exposures and outcomes of interest. The field has been challenged by high false-positive report rates. MR-Hevo is an MR causal effect estimation methodology whose creators claim fewer false-positive reports versus the established weighted median estimator (WME) method.

## Aims

To evaluate any difference in causal effect estimates between WME versus MR-Hevo methods, and establish whether these may alter conclusions drawn in real-world studies.

## Methods

Performance of each method was compared through parallel analysis of simulated data with known characteristics. Data were simulated per the published approach used to validate WME. Simulations represented a range of plausible combinations of population parameters and assumption violations. To investigate differences between methods using real-world data, both methods were applied to a sample of ten highly-cited MR studies reporting both a WME causal effect estimate and sufficient data to allow replication.

## Results

Using simulated data with no causal effect present, MR-Hevo demonstrated a lower false-positive report rate versus WME across all 24 combinations of parameters/assumption violations considered (mean false-positive report rate 0.41% versus 5.1%). Using simulated data with a true causal effect present, MR-Hevo demonstrated variable sensitivity versus WME depending on the combination of parameters/assumption violations considered. In general, both higher false-positive rate and higher sensitivity with WME versus MR-Hevo analysis correlated with assumption violations which tended to bias away from the null, suggesting MR-Hevo may be more robust to assumption violations. Re-analysis of highly-cited MR studies found poor reproducibility of published WME estimates in four of ten studies included. Causal effect estimates were similar in magnitude between MR-Hevo and WME; conclusions regarding presence of causality were consistent between both methods across all ten studies.

## Conclusions

Compared to WME, MR-Hevo causal effect estimation is associated with lower false-positive report rates and less perturbation by assumption violations. Across published MR literature reporting a causal effect, re-analysis using MR-Hevo may change conclusions in a minority of cases. Future work should investigate the non-reproducibility of MR results observed.

	abstract = {Current methods for Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses are restricted to single SNP instruments, and cannot reliably infer causality with instruments that are mostly weak and pleiotropic. We describe methods to overcome these limitations: key innovations are construction of scalar instruments from multiple SNPs, use of a regularized horseshoe prior, and hypothesis tests based on the marginal likelihood of the causal effect parameter. To demonstrate the approach, we constructed genotypic instruments from unlinked trans-pQTLs detected in two large GWAS studies of plasma proteins, and tested the top 20 genes for which the aggregated effects of the instruments was associated with type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank cohort. The only protein with clear evidence of a causal effect on type 2 diabetes was adiponectin, encoded by ADIPOQ: standardized log odds ratio -0.34 (95\% CI -0.44 to -0.24) using UK Biobank instruments. These results have implications for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization studies. Where the exposure under study is expression of a gene, restricting the instruments to cis-acting variants is likely to miss causal effects. Tests based on the marginal likelihood should supersede other methods of testing for causality in the presence of pleiotropy.},

Several options are available to the user, such as the use of robust regression, fixed- or random-effects models and the penalization of weights for genetic variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. Extensions to these methods, such as allowing for variants to be correlated, can be chosen if appropriate. Graphical commands allow summarized data to be displayed in an interactive graph, or the plotting of causal estimates from multiple methods, for comparison. Although the main method of data entry is directly by the user, there is also an option for allowing summarized data to be incorporated from the PhenoScanner database of genotype{\textemdash}phenotype associations. We hope to develop this feature in future versions of the package. The R software environment is available for download from [https://www.r-project.org/].

The reliability of a MR investigation depends on the validity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables~(IVs). We develop the contamination mixture method, a method for MR with two modalities. First, it identifies groups of genetic variants with similar causal estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Second, it performs MR robustly and efficiently in the presence of invalid IVs. Compared to other robust methods, it has the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method identifies 11 variants associated with increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased coronary heart disease risk that have the same directions of associations with various blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and coronary heart disease risk mediated via platelet aggregation.},

We therefore developed MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.},

	abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful epidemiological method for causal inference. However, its recent surge in popularity has brought two concerning trends. First, the public availability of summary results from genome-wide association studies has led to an explosion of low-quality two-sample mendelian randomization (2SMR) studies. These studies add minimal {\textendash} if any {\textendash} value and overwhelm reviewers and journals. Second, the availability of large datasets with individual-level genotype data, like UK Biobank, has spurred the development and use of novel MR methods. However, some methods are being applied without proper testing, leading to misleading results, as exemplified by recent spurious findings that are being retracted and/or corrected relating to vitamin D. What can editors and peer reviewers do to handle the deluge of 2SMR studies and the premature application of highly complex MR methods? We advise editors to simply reject papers that only report 2SMR findings, with no additional supporting evidence. For reviewers receiving such papers, we provide a template for rejection. In addition, reviewers should demand rigorous testing of novel methods, including through the use of positive and negative controls before they are applied. Rejecting non-contributory 2SMR papers and imposing intensive scrutiny to novel methods is crucial if the scientific community is to reclaim MR.},

However, the causality and direction of this association are not clear; physical activity may protect against depression, and/or depression may result in decreased physical activity.To examine bidirectional relationships between physical activity and depression using a genetically informed method for assessing potential causal inference.This 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) used  independent top genetic variants associated with 2 physical activity phenotypes{\textemdash}self-reported (n = 377 234) and objective accelerometer-based (n = 91 084){\textemdash}and with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 143 265) as genetic instruments from the largest available, nonoverlapping genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS were previously conducted in diverse observational cohorts, including the UK Biobank (for physical activity) and participating studies in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (for MDD) among adults of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization estimates from each genetic instrument were combined using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, with alternate methods (eg, weighted median, MR Egger, MR{\textendash}Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier [PRESSO]) and multiple sensitivity analyses to assess horizontal pleiotropy and remove outliers. Data were analyzed from May 10 through July 31, 2018.MDD and physical activity.GWAS summary data were available for a combined sample size of 611 583 adult participants. Mendelian randomization evidence suggested a protective relationship between accelerometer-based activity and MDD (odds ratio [OR], 0.74 for MDD per 1-SD increase in mean acceleration; 95\% CI, 0.59-0.92; P = .006). In contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship between MDD and accelerometer-based activity ($\beta$ = -0.08 in mean acceleration per MDD vs control status; 95\% CI, -0.47 to 0.32; P = .70). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between self-reported activity and MDD (OR, 1.28 for MDD per 1-SD increase in metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity; 95\% CI, 0.57-3.37; P = .48), or between MDD and self-reported activity ($\beta$ = 0.02 per MDD in standardized metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity per MDD vs control status; 95\% CI, -0.008 to 0.05; P = .15).Using genetic instruments identified from large-scale GWAS, robust evidence supports a protective relationship between objectively assessed{\textemdash}but not self-reported{\textemdash}physical activity and the risk for MDD. Findings point to the importance of objective measurement of physical activity in epidemiologic studies of mental health and support the hypothesis that enhancing physical activity may be an effective prevention strategy for depression.},

	abstract = {To correct for confounding, the method of instrumental variables (IV) has been proposed. Its use in medical literature is still rather limited because of unfamiliarity or inapplicability. By introducing the method in a nontechnical way, we show that IV in a linear model is quite easy to understand and easy to apply once an appropriate instrumental variable has been identified. We also point out some limitations of the IV estimator when the instrumental variable is only weakly correlated with the exposure. The IV estimator will be imprecise (large standard error), biased when sample size is small, and biased in large samples when one of the assumptions is only slightly violated. For these reasons, it is advised to use an IV that is strongly correlated with exposure. However, we further show that under the assumptions required for the validity of the method, this correlation between IV and exposure is limited. Its maximum is low when confounding is strong, such as in case of confounding by indication. Finally, we show that in a study in which strong confounding is to be expected and an IV has been used that is moderately or strongly related to exposure, it is likely that the assumptions of IV are violated, resulting in a biased effect estimate. We conclude that instrumental variables can be useful in case of moderate confounding but are less useful when strong confounding exists, because strong instruments cannot be found and assumptions will be easily violated.},

	abstract = {This issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology reprints a seminal letter to the editor by Martijn Katan,1 which appears to be the first description of the concept of {\textquoteleft}Mendelian randomization.{\textquoteright} In discussing the controversy over whether the association between low serum cholesterol and cancer is causal or might simply reflect an effect of the disease to lower cholesterol levels ({\textquoteleft}reverse causation{\textquoteright}) or confounding by diet or other factors, Katan proposed a test of causality by studying instead the relationship between cancer and a genetic determinant of serum cholesterol, the apolipoprotein A (APOE) gene. His rationale was that since alleles are allocated essentially at random, such an association would not be subject to either confounding or reverse causation. Thus, if a causal relationship between APOE and serum cholesterol were clearly established, then an association between APOE and cancer would provide indirect evidence for the causality of the association between serum cholesterol and cancer. Although Katan did not use the term {\textquoteleft}Mendelian randomization{\textquoteright}, the concept has been attributed to him and subsequently developed by a number of other authors.2{\textendash}6 In particular, Davey Smith and Ebrahim2 have shown how the magnitude of the estimated effects of a gene (G) on an intermediate phenotype (IP) and on disease (D) can be combined to yield an estimate of the causal effect of the intermediate phenotype on disease, as illustrated in the following figure:  (where the dotted arrow from G to D represents the indirect association assumed to be mediated entirely through IP).},

Emphasising the parallels to randomisation may increase understanding of the underlying assumptions within epidemiology. An instrument is a variable that predicts exposure, but conditional on exposure shows no independent association with the outcome. The random assignment in trials is an example of what would be expected to be an ideal instrument, but instruments can also be found in observational settings with a naturally varying phenomenon e.g. geographical variation, physical distance to facility or physician{\textquoteright}s preference. The fourth identifying assumption has received less attention, but is essential for the generalisability of estimated effects. The instrument identifies the group of compliers in which exposure is pseudo-randomly assigned leading to exchangeability with regard to unmeasured confounders. Underlying assumptions can only partially be tested empirically and require subject-matter knowledge. Future studies employing instruments should carefully seek to validate all four assumptions, possibly drawing on parallels to randomisation.},

All measured genetic variants combined explained 11\% of the variance. Gene-based tests revealed 35 significant genes in 16 regions, and S-PrediXcan analyses showed that 21 genes had different expression levels for cannabis users versus nonusers. The strongest finding across the different analyses was CADM2, which has been associated with substance use and risk-taking. Significant genetic correlations were found with 14 of 25 tested substance use and mental health{\textendash}related traits, including smoking, alcohol use, schizophrenia and risk-taking.

	abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is an approach for obtaining causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not associated with any confounder of the exposure{\textendash}outcome association, nor is there any causal pathway from the instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated. There are several methods available for instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method, two-stage methods, likelihood-based methods, and semi-parametric methods. Techniques for obtaining statistical inferences and confidence intervals are presented. The statistical properties of estimates from these methods are compared, and practical advice is given about choosing a suitable analysis method. In particular, bias and coverage properties of estimators are considered, especially with weak instruments. Settings particularly relevant to Mendelian randomization are prioritized in the paper, notably the scenario of a continuous exposure and a continuous or binary outcome.},

Opportunities to apply MR are growing rapidly with the increasing number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, existing MR methods rely on strong assumptions that are often violated, leading to false positives. Correlated horizontal pleiotropy, which arises when variants affect both traits through a heritable shared factor, remains a particularly challenging problem. We propose a new MR method, Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE), that accounts for correlated and uncorrelated horizontal pleiotropic effects. We demonstrate, in simulations, that CAUSE avoids more false positives induced by correlated horizontal pleiotropy than other methods. Applied to traits studied in recent GWAS studies, we find that CAUSE detects causal relationships that have strong literature support and avoids identifying most unlikely relationships. Our results suggest that shared heritable factors are common and may lead to many false positives using alternative methods.},

Those who received allogeneic blood transfusions were assigned to nonoverlapping {\textquotedblleft}younger,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}middle,{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}older{\textquotedblright} RBC storage duration groups. Those who received autologous RBC transfusions were analyzed using the maximum storage duration as the primary exposure. We evaluated the association between RBC storage duration and biochemical recurrence using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression., RESULTS: A total of 405 patients received allogeneic transfusions. At 5 years, the biochemical recurrence{\textendash}free survival rate was 74\%, 71\%, and 76\% for patients who received younger, middle, and older RBCs, respectively; our Cox model indicated no significant differences in biochemical recurrence rates between the groups (P=.82; Wald test). Among patients who received autologous transfusions (n=350), maximum RBC age was not significantly associated with biochemical cancer recurrence (P=.95). At 5 years, the biochemical recurrence{\textendash}free survival rate was 85\% and 81\% for patients who received younger and older than 21-day-old RBCs, respectively., CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing radical prostatectomy who require RBC transfusion, recurrence risk does not appear to be independently associated with blood storage duration., The authors evaluated the association between duration of red blood cell storage and biochemical recurrence of cancer in men who had undergone radical prostatectomy and perioperative blood transfusions.

	abstract = {Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include a cluster of metabolic conditions such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Given that these risk factors are correlated, separating out causal from confounded effects is challenging. Mendelian randomization (MR), or the use of genetic instrumental variables, may facilitate the identification of the metabolic drivers of pancreatic cancer.We identified genetic instruments for obesity, body shape, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in order to evaluate their causal role in pancreatic cancer etiology. These instruments were analyzed in relation to risk using a likelihood-based MR approach within a series of 7110 pancreatic cancer patients and 7264 control subjects using genome-wide data from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Potential unknown pleiotropic effects were assessed using a weighted median approach and MR-Egger sensitivity analyses.Results indicated a robust causal association of increasing body mass index (BMI) with pancreatic cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.65, for each standard deviation increase in BMI [4.6 kg/m2]). There was also evidence that genetically increased fasting insulin levels were causally associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.66, 95\% CI = 1.05 to 2.63, per SD [44.4 pmol/L]). Notably, no evidence of a causal relationship was observed for type 2 diabetes, nor for dyslipidemia. Sensitivity analyses did not indicate that pleiotropy was an important source of bias.Our results suggest a causal role of BMI and fasting insulin in pancreatic cancer etiology.},

Design Mendelian randomisation study.
Setting UK Biobank and international genome-wide association study data.
Participants Predominantly participants of European ancestry.
Exposure Educational attainment, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour in observational analysis, and randomly allocated genetic variants to instrument these traits in mendelian randomisation.
Main outcomes measure The risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease (all subtypes; all measured in odds ratio), and the degree to which this is mediated through BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour respectively.
Results Each additional standard deviation of education (3.6 years) was associated with a 13\% lower risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.86, 95\% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.89) in observational analysis and a 37\% lower risk (0.63, 0.60 to 0.67) in mendelian randomisation analysis. As a proportion of the total risk reduction, BMI was estimated to mediate 15\% (95\% confidence interval 13\% to 17\%) and 18\% (14\% to 23\%) in the observational and mendelian randomisation estimates, respectively. Corresponding estimates were 11\% (9\% to 13\%) and 21\% (15\% to 27\%) for systolic blood pressure and 19\% (15\% to 22\%) and 34\% (17\% to 50\%) for smoking behaviour. All three risk factors combined were estimated to mediate 42\% (36\% to 48\%) and 36\% (5\% to 68\%) of the effect of education on coronary heart disease in observational and mendelian randomisation analyses, respectively. Similar results were obtained when investigating the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions BMI, systolic blood pressure, and smoking behaviour mediate a substantial proportion of the protective effect of education on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intervening on these would lead to reductions in cases of cardiovascular disease attributable to lower levels of education. However, more than half of the protective effect of education remains unexplained and requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {Background
Growing evidence has shown that alterations in gut microbiota composition are associated with multiple autoimmune diseases (ADs). However, it is unclear whether these associations reflect a causal relationship.

Objective
To reveal the causal association between gut microbiota and AD, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.

Materials and Methods
We assessed genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for gut microbiota and six common ADs, namely, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes (T1D), and celiac disease (CeD), from published GWASs. Two-sample MR analyses were first performed to identify causal bacterial taxa for ADs in discovery samples. Significant bacterial taxa were further replicated in independent replication outcome samples. A series of sensitivity analyses was performed to validate the robustness of the results. Finally, a reverse MR analysis was performed to evaluate the possibility of reverse causation.

Results
Combining the results from the discovery and replication stages, we identified one causal bacterial genus, Bifidobacterium. A higher relative abundance of the Bifidobacterium genus was associated with a higher risk of T1D [odds ratio (OR): 1.605; 95\% CI, 1.339{\textendash}1.922; PFDR = 4.19 {\texttimes} 10-7] and CeD (OR: 1.401; 95\% CI, 1.139{\textendash}1.722; PFDR = 2.03 {\texttimes} 10-3), respectively. Further sensitivity analyses validated the robustness of the above associations. The results of reverse MR analysis showed no evidence of reverse causality from T1D and CeD to the Bifidobacterium genus.

Conclusion
This study implied a causal relationship between the Bifidobacterium genus and T1D and CeD, thus providing novel insights into the gut microbiota-mediated development mechanism of ADs.},

	abstract = {Background Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease that has been reported to be associated with obesity. We aimed to investigate a possible causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and psoriasis. Methods and findings Following a review of published epidemiological evidence of the association between obesity and psoriasis, mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test for a causal relationship with BMI. We used a genetic instrument comprising 97 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI as a proxy for BMI (expected to be much less confounded than measured BMI). One-sample MR was conducted using individual-level data (396,495 individuals) from the UK Biobank and the Nord-Tr{\o}ndelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway. Two-sample MR was performed with summary-level data (356,926 individuals) from published BMI and psoriasis genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The one-sample and two-sample MR estimates were meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model. To test for a potential reverse causal effect, MR analysis with genetic instruments comprising variants from recent genome-wide analyses for psoriasis were used to test whether genetic risk for this skin disease has a causal effect on BMI. Published observational data showed an association of higher BMI with psoriasis. A mean difference in BMI of 1.26 kg/m2 (95\% CI 1.02{\textendash}1.51) between psoriasis cases and controls was observed in adults, while a 1.55 kg/m2 mean difference (95\% CI 1.13{\textendash}1.98) was observed in children. The observational association was confirmed in UK Biobank and HUNT data sets. Overall, a 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with 4\% higher odds of psoriasis (meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95\% CI 1.03{\textendash}1.04; P = 1.73 {\texttimes} 10-60). MR analyses provided evidence that higher BMI causally increases the odds of psoriasis (by 9\% per 1 unit increase in BMI; OR = 1.09 (1.06{\textendash}1.12) per 1 kg/m2; P = 4.67 {\texttimes} 10-9). In contrast, MR estimates gave little support to a possible causal effect of psoriasis genetic risk on BMI (0.004 kg/m2 change in BMI per doubling odds of psoriasis (-0.003 to 0.011). Limitations of our study include possible misreporting of psoriasis by patients, as well as potential misdiagnosis by clinicians. In addition, there is also limited ethnic variation in the cohorts studied. Conclusions Our study, using genetic variants as instrumental variables for BMI, provides evidence that higher BMI leads to a higher risk of psoriasis. This supports the prioritization of therapies and lifestyle interventions aimed at controlling weight for the prevention or treatment of this common skin disease. Mechanistic studies are required to improve understanding of this relationship.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims:~
          Early identification of modifiable risk factors is essential for the prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to systematically explore the relationships between genetically predicted modifiable risk factors and NAFLD.
          Approach and Results:~
          We applied univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore the relationships between 35 modifiable risk factors and NAFLD. We also evaluated the combined results in three independent large genome-wide association studies. Genetically predicted alcohol frequency, elevated serum levels of liver enzymes, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and obesity traits, including body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat mass, were associated with increased risks of NAFLD (all with p {\textless} 0.05). Poor physical condition had a suggestive increased risk for NAFLD (odds ratio [OR]~=~2.63, p~=~0.042). Genetically instrumented type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension all increased the risk for NAFLD, and the ORs (95\% confidence interval) were 1.508 (1.20{\textendash}1.90), 13.08 (1.53{\textendash}111.65), and 3.11 (1.33{\textendash}7.31) for a 1-U increase in log-transformed odds, respectively. The positive associations of T2DM and hypertension with NAFLD remained significant in multivariable analyses. The combined results from the discovery and two replication datasets further confirmed that alcohol frequency, elevated serum liver enzymes, poor physical condition, obesity traits, T2DM, and hypertension significantly increase the risk of NAFLD, whereas higher education and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) could lower NAFLD risk.
          Conclusions:~
          Genetically predicted alcohol frequency, elevated serum liver enzymes, poor physical condition, obesity traits, T2DM, and hypertension were associated with an increased risk of NAFLD, whereas higher education and HDL-cholesterol were associated with a decreased risk of NAFLD.

Methods We undertook large-scale observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses using UK Biobank. Most recent smoking status was determined from primary care records (70.8\%) and UK Biobank questionnaire data (29.2\%). COVID-19 outcomes were derived from Public Health England SARS-CoV-2 testing data, hospital admissions data, and death certificates (until 18 August 2020). Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between smoking status and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death. Inverse variance-weighted MR analyses using established genetic instruments for smoking initiation and smoking heaviness were undertaken (reported per SD increase).
Results There were 421 469 eligible participants, 1649 confirmed infections, 968 COVID-19-related hospitalisations and 444 COVID-19-related deaths. Compared with never-smokers, current smokers had higher risks of hospitalisation (OR 1.80, 95\% CI 1.26 to 2.29) and mortality (smoking 1{\textendash}9/day: OR 2.14, 95\% CI 0.87 to 5.24; 10{\textendash}19/day: OR 5.91, 95\% CI 3.66 to 9.54; 20+/day: OR 6.11, 95\% CI 3.59 to 10.42). In MR analyses of 281 105 White British participants, genetically predicted propensity to initiate smoking was associated with higher risks of infection (OR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.91) and hospitalisation (OR 1.60, 95\% CI 1.13 to 2.27). Genetically predicted higher number of cigarettes smoked per day was associated with higher risks of all outcomes (infection OR 2.51, 95\% CI 1.20 to 5.24; hospitalisation OR 5.08, 95\% CI 2.04 to 12.66; and death OR 10.02, 95\% CI 2.53 to 39.72).
Interpretation Congruent results from two analytical approaches support a causal effect of smoking on risk of severe COVID-19.},

This may be caused by publication bias through the decisions of journal editors, by selective reporting of research results by authors or by a combination of both. Typically, study results that are statistically significant or have larger estimated effect sizes are more likely to appear in the published literature, hence giving a biased picture of the evidence-base. Previous statistical approaches for addressing dissemination bias have assumed only a single selection mechanism. Here we consider a more realistic scenario in which multiple dissemination processes, involving both the publishing authors and journals, are operating. In practical applications, the methods can be used to provide sensitivity analyses for the potential effects of multiple dissemination biases operating in meta-analysis.

	abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy)., Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger{\textquoteright}s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables., Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples., Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

	abstract = {A major application for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been the emerging field of causal inference using Mendelian randomization (MR), where the causal effect between a pair of traits can be estimated using only summary level data. MR depends on SNPs exhibiting vertical pleiotropy, where the SNP influences an outcome phenotype only through an exposure phenotype. Issues arise when this assumption is violated due to SNPs exhibiting horizontal pleiotropy. We demonstrate that across a range of pleiotropy models, instrument selection will be increasingly liable to selecting invalid instruments as GWAS sample sizes continue to grow. Methods have been developed in an attempt to protect MR from different patterns of horizontal pleiotropy, and here we have designed a mixture-of-experts machine learning framework (MR-MoE 1.0) that predicts the most appropriate model to use for any specific causal analysis, improving on both power and false discovery rates. Using the approach, we systematically estimated the causal effects amongst 2407 phenotypes. Almost 90\% of causal estimates indicated some level of horizontal pleiotropy. The causal estimates are organised into a publicly available graph database (http://eve.mrbase.org), and we use it here to highlight the numerous challenges that remain in automated causal inference.},

	abstract = {Much research effort is invested in attempting to determine causal influences on disease onset and progression to inform prevention and treatment efforts. However, this is often dependent on observational data that are prone to well-known limitations, particularly residual confounding and reverse causality. Several statistical methods have been developed to support stronger causal inference. However, a complementary approach is to use design-based methods for causal inference, which acknowledge sources of bias and attempt to mitigate these through the design of the study rather than solely through statistical adjustment. Genetically informed methods provide a novel and potentially powerful extension to this approach, accounting by design for unobserved genetic and environmental confounding. No single approach will be absent from bias. Instead, we should seek and combine evidence from multiple methodologies that each bring different (and ideally uncorrelated) sources of bias. If the results of these different methodologies align{\textemdash}or triangulate{\textemdash}then we can be more confident in our causal inference. To be truly effective, this should ideally be done prospectively, with the sources of evidence specified in advance, to protect against one final source of bias{\textemdash}our own cognitions, expectations, and fondly held beliefs.},

We find abundant evidence of pleiotropy; 233 (16.9\%) genes and 77 (4.6\%) SNPs show pleiotropic effects. SNP pleiotropic status was associated with gene location (p = 0.024; pleiotropic SNPs more often exonic [14.5\% versus 4.9\% for nonpleiotropic, trait-associated SNPs] and less often intergenic [15.8\% versus 23.6\%]), {\textquotedblleft}predicted transcript consequence{\textquotedblright} (p = 0.001; pleiotropic SNPs more often predicted to be structurally deleterious [5\% versus 0.4\%] but not more often in regulatory sequences), and certain disease classes. We develop a method to calculate the likelihood that pleiotropic links between traits occurred more often than expected and demonstrate that this approach can identify etiological links that are already known (such as between fetal hemoglobin and malaria risk) and those that are not yet established (e.g., between plasma campesterol levels and gallstones risk; and between immunoglobulin A and juvenile idiopathic arthritis). Examples of pleiotropy will accumulate over time, but it is already clear that pleiotropy is a common property of genes and SNPs associated with disease traits, and this will have implications for identification of molecular targets for drug development, future genetic risk-profiling, and classification of diseases.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC{\textquoteright}s performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient {\textquotedblleft}turnkey{\textquotedblright} samplers.},

As with tutorials outlining the calculus behind maximum likelihood in previous decades, a simple description of the machinery of MCMC is needed. We provide an introduction to conducting analyses with MCMC, and show that, given the same data and under certain model specifications, the results of an MCMC simulation match those of methods based on standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). In addition, we highlight examples of instances in which MCMC approaches to data analysis provide a clear advantage over MLE.
